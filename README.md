<img src="tdl.png" alt="EJS Project Overview" width="600" height="500">

This project is a simple To-Do List web app. Users can manage their daily tasks by adding, completing, and tracking them in real time. Completed tasks are moved to a separate list, and they are visually updated with a strike-through and color change to indicate completion.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to the "Incomplete Tasks" section with a simple input field.
- **Complete Tasks**: Click on a task to mark it as completed, moving it to the "Completed Tasks" section.
- **Visual Updates**: Completed tasks have a distinctive style, with a strike-through and background color change.
- **Responsive Design**: The web app is fully responsive and optimized for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure and layout of the To-Do List.
- **CSS3**: Samsung-themed styling for a modern and clean look.
- **JavaScript**: Adds functionality to dynamically update and manage tasks.

## Code Structure

### HTML
The HTML defines the structure of the page, including input fields, buttons, and task lists.

- Adding new tasks to the list
- Marking tasks as completed
- Moving tasks between lists

## Future Enhancements

- **Edit Tasks**: Allow users to edit existing tasks.
